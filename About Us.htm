    <p>
    Chicago Developmental Disability Organization is a community-based organization advocating for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) and serving them and their families. We work tirelessly to uphold our vision that every individual and family living with I/DD in our service areas has access to the information, advocacy, and skills they need to support their full inclusion and participation in the community throughout their lifetimes. We provide services without regard to a person’s race, color, religion, social or financial status.
    
    The Chicago Developmental Disability Organization was founded in 1980 by parents who believed their children with I/DD deserved should be included in their communities and pursue a happy life just like everyone else. Ever since then, it has continued to grow and evolve along with the changing needs and issues people with disabilities and their families face — and has played a pivotal role in changing the public perception of disability.
